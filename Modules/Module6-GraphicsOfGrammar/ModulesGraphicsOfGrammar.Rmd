# Module 6 Goals
- What is the Grammar of Graphics in ggplot?
- What is the central metaphor?
- Why are ggplot graphics more difficult to create at times?
- What is a fast way to create ggplot graphics?
- What is a facet?

# What is Grammar of Graphics?
Different components to graphics
Data and aesthetic mappings
Geometric objects
Scales
Facet specifications
Statistical transformations
Coordinate system
Graphics are built upon layers
Data and mapping
Statistical transformation
Example Time
ggplot ->create new graphic object
+ layer( â€¦) -> add a layer
The data is diamonds dataset
Map carat to horizontal 
Map price to vertical
geom -> display as points in the given position
These are continuous points
Use a Cartesian coordinate system
Another way to write it
The result
Geometric objects
qplot
qplot facets
What are examples of facets?
Need to be categorical variables
How large should they be?
Examples in University data
qplot -ERROR
Box and jitter
