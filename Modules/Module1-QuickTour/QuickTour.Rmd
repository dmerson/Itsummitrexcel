![Give it a name](../../Images/NewProject3.png)

If you know GIT you can create a GIT Repository but everyone should check "Open in new Session.""

#Project Created

You should see your project and the R Studio interface.

#Console

The console is like DOS in Windows and Terminal in Mac or an SSH Shell.

```{r}
print("Hello IT Summit")
```
Try the following:
- What happens if don't use the quotes?
- What if you type "prin" and then hit the tab key?
Notice the [1] next to your result. (We will talk about that later)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
