#Module 2 Goals
- Data Types
- Vectors
- Matrixes
- Lists
- Tibbles and DataFrames
- Import and Export Data
- Data Provenance
- Viewing Data in R
- Display columns of DataFrames

Understanding R from Excel
Vector in Excel
3 rows in 1 column


Type in Excel vs. R
Ignores text
In R converts to first value
Vectors in R
Allow quick transformations

Can run operations on each item
Vector operations like multiply
Different from aggregates like sum
Summarize into single value (vector of 1)
na =NULL
Matrix
Excel is Column-Row (B2)
R is row-column[3,2]
Moâ€™ Matrix
Can get rows or columns
Result is vector
Tables in Excel =DataFrame in R
DataFrame$ColumnName
Import data from Excel
We now have a tibbles
(not a whole lot different but better for technical reasons of conversion)
Factors =categorical variables
Data Provenance
Excel is destructive
Make changes =changes data
 R can keep original data
If make mistakes can rerun the script

Other Data Imports- Read(base)
Write and read data csv
Ways to view data
Subseting and filtering
More ways to view data
Filter in View mode
Functions vs Sub
Functions return a value
In R have return statement in parens
Can be on multiple lines
Make your own functions
Pro advice
Do 1 thing
Verify it works (Check it in)
Do the next thing
Make it better
